# MLproject
A capstone project for Data Scientist Bootcamp Certification

# Project Scope:
Building the Machine Learning Model

# Project Problem Statement
A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments, which should be safe from fraud. Hence, is important that credit card companies recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items they did not purchase.

# Project Objective:
To build a Machine Learning classification model with a Classifier to predict whether a creditcard transaction is fraudulent or not.

# Project Methodology:
## To Accomplish the Project Below are the Methodological Steps to Follow:
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze and understand the data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data by using Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations.
* Data Cleaning: This might include standardization, handling the missing values and outliers in the data.
* Dealing with Imbalanced data: This data set is highly imbalanced. The data should be balanced using the appropriate methods before moving onto model building.
* Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform the existing features for better performance of the ML Models.
* Model Selection: Choose the most appropriate model that can be used for this project.
* Model Training: Split the data into train & test sets and use the train set to estimate the best model parameters.
* Model Validation: Evaluate the performance of the model on data that was not used during the training process. The goal is to estimate the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data and to identify any issues with the model, such as overfitting.
* Model Deployment: Model deployment is the process of making a trained machine learning model available for use in a production environment.
